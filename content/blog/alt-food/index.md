With the rise of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, it’s become clear that alternative food has a place in progressive society (though its current place in the hype cycle betrays its limited adoption so far). Today, I wanted to talk about one of the hottest startups taking on alternative food not in meat, but in dairy products, Perfect Day. Then, I want to discuss the path forward for alternative food.

Alternative dairy has many ethical and environmental benefits-- including avoiding overuse of antibiotics, factory farming, and no added hormones. Still, it’s clear that to be commercially viable, Perfect Day and other alternative food companies will have to give the public something more to look forward to. 

Perfect Day uses synthetic biology processes to ferment milk proteins in microflora, and their primary product is an animal-free whey protein isolate. It received FDA approval earlier this year, and, after raising a massive $300M Series C funding round, Perfect Day announced a spinout product-- _Brave Robot_ ice cream.

Bob Iger, former Disney CEO, clearly sees potential in the company’s mission, joining the Perfect Day board of directors just this October. Personally, I think the mission of alternative food companies is laudable. I subscribe to the idea that the food of the future will need to be produced sustainably. Still, the promise of companies like Beyond Meat and Perfect Day living up to the hype their gigantic funding rounds and overvalued stock prices will be difficult to fulfill.

For companies like Perfect Day, I would love to see the company add to their arsenal of animal-free dairy products with not only conventional offerings, but also original concepts. Some companies, like JUST have explored this idea. JUST Egg Folded is an egg replacement that can be popped into a toaster or microwave, and while it reportedly tastes like a cooked egg, it only clearly deviates from it in form.

In order for consumers to adopt alternative products, at least in our current environment, it is not enough to merely imitate existing food-- the players I’m most interested in are those that are willing to take creative risks and design _truly futuristic food_. If food is produced through a futuristic fermentation process, then I see no reason why it needs to resemble the more traditional foods we are all familiar with. Instead, alternative foods should be marketed as fresh, fashionable, and futuristic.

Alternative food companies are making innovative strides in environmentally friendly and ethical food production. They should mirror these with innovations in their presentation. The biggest players in the alternative food space will be those that make waves with catchy, futuristic foods, not just leeching off existing products.
